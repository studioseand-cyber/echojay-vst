# ship_2026-09-21t-g - the signing steps IN ORDER, for BOTH bundles. 21t-g changes both, on top of the
# INSTALLED 21t-f: the guard suite's teardown crash is fixed (five defects, soak 6/6, fast suite 44/44),
# the calibration loop runs PASSIVE by default with a threshold actuator, the turn carries [TRACK LEVELS],
# and RegistrySlot's alignment claim matches the mapping with every field offset frozen.
#   1. codesign the nested EchoJayProbe helper in EACH bundle FIRST (hardened runtime + the
#      disable-library-validation and allow-unsigned-executable-memory entitlements it needs to dlopen
#      third-party AUs) - this script.
#   2. wraptool sign ... on each bundle as before (PACE), which signs the bundle over the already-signed helper.
#   3. codesign --verify --deep --strict on each bundle: "valid on disk" and "satisfies its Designated Requirement".
