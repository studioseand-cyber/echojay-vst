# EJ Map certification driver: design requirements

Branch `feat/ejmap-cert`. The driver is step 5 of the certification plan and is
not written yet. These are requirements established by measurement before it
exists, recorded where whoever writes it will find them.

The split is decision D2 (28 Sep): the signed probe (`tools/au_instantiate_probe`)
MEASURES, and EJ Map DERIVES and ORCHESTRATES. The test for where a piece of logic
goes is whether changing it needs re-measuring or only re-computing. A formula
change must never cost a rebuild and a re-sign.

## 1. Sign once, at the start of a run, and fail loudly if signing blocks

PACE refuses an unsigned probe ("fatal wrapper bootstrap error", 21 Sep, df407ab),
so every run starts from a signed binary.

Measured 28 Sep on the dev Mac: `codesign` with the Developer ID, `--timestamp`,
`--options runtime` and the entitlements took 1.13 s, then 0.49 s and 0.48 s. No
keychain prompt appeared (SecurityAgent never ran), because the key already
allows codesign.

That holds only while the login keychain is unlocked. A locked keychain (after
logout, or with lock-on-sleep), or a session with no logged-in GUI, can put up
a prompt. `codesign` then blocks and does not fail. A driver that signs lazily,
or per product, would hang in the middle of an unattended batch.

Therefore:
- Sign exactly ONCE, before the first product, and verify the result
  (`codesign --verify --strict`).
- Put a deadline on the signing step (a few seconds against a 1 s measurement).
  If it has not returned, abort the whole run before touching any plugin, and say
  that signing blocked and a keychain prompt is the likely cause.
- Never sign again mid-run. The binary does not change during a run.
- Record the probe's identity in the run report: its code-directory hash, or its
  UUID from `dwarfdump --uuid` / `otool -l`. That records which probe measured
  what; the version string does not.

## 2. The driver owns every timeout

The probe has its own 30 s bound in list mode, but it cannot interrupt a call
that blocks inside plugin code. Measured 28 Sep: `--list-params` on kHs
Compressor (AU manufacturer code `" kHs"`, with a leading space) printed its
header line and then nothing for more than 60 s, past its own bound, until it was
killed from outside. Nothing was recorded about why. The leading space is not the
explanation: JUCE's stringToOSType keeps a padded code intact (it trims only when
4 characters would remain), and Decapitator's padded "DEC " instantiated normally.

Therefore the driver runs every probe with its own deadline and kills the process
on expiry. It records a timeout as a timeout, not a refusal: the retry rule is
"-15 / killed = re-run alone once, and two timeouts mark a hang". The probe's own
bound is a convenience, never the guarantee.

## 3. The fixture unit rule is EJ Map's

The 74 compressor-profile fixtures derived `unit` in an uncommitted sampling
pass. The rule is now written down and pinned:

- the code: `tools/ejmap/Source/EjmapFixtureUnit.h`, which carries the full
  evidence and the four exceptions
- the pins: `testFixtureUnitRule` in `tools/ejmap/tests/RoundTripTest.cpp`, run
  by the pre-commit gate

In short: take the label when present; otherwise the text after a leading number
at the 0.0 point, falling back to the 1.0 point; the 0.5 point is never read. A
bare leading dot is not a number. It was measured against real labels on 13
products (435 controls, all labels empty, 88 units, all reproduced), and it gives
a unit to none of the 1,096 controls whose fixture has none.

When the driver regenerates the 74 fixtures, it applies this rule to the probe's
`--text-at` output. A fixture that disagrees afterwards is a finding to report,
not something to silently re-derive.
